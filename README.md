# QUESTIONS APP

- User story: as a user, I want to be able to add questions and answers to use as a way to test my knowledge while taking a test.
- Problem: users can evaluate their knowledge using a test, so the system should provide the ability to create questions and answers for it, as well as set the correct answers for subsequent verification by the system.
